How Elon Musk’s Starlink Is Bringing In Billions For SpaceX,"Starlink is SpaceX’s answer to providing global, high-speed internet coverage using a network of thousands of satellites buzzing around the planet in a region known as low Earth orbit (LEO), about 342 miles above the Earth’s surface. SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites back in 2019, and since then, adoption of the service has ballooned. Starlink now has over 2 million active customers and is available on all 7 continents and in over 60 countries. Starlink has been praised for its ability to connect remote parts of the world that would otherwise not have access to reliable internet. The service has also become indispensable in areas hit by natural disasters, and, more recently, during times of war, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war. But Starlink’s growing influence is garnering condemnation from some who say that SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk is meddling in geopolitics, while the scientific community is raising alarms of the effect of thousands of satellites on radio and optical astronomy.

How Americans Are Tricked Into Buying Fake Food,"The food in your kitchen cabinets may not be what it seems. Fraudsters motivated by economic gain secretly infiltrate the global food market through a variety of means, including counterfeits, dilutions, substitution and mislabeling, according to the Global Food Safety Initiative. This may not only harm consumers’ wallets, but it can also put public health and safety at risk. Some estimates say food fraud affects at least 1% of the global food industry at a cost as high as $40 billion a year, according to the FDA.

"Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 01 ""THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER""","To register for the 2015 course, visit https://www.edx.org/course/justice-harvardx-er22-1x-0. 

PART ONE: THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER
If you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing—what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums—each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. 

PART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISM

Sandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism—and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces ""the greatest good for the greatest number.""",kBdfcR-8hEY

POLITICAL THEORY - Karl Marx,"Karl Marx remains deeply important today not as the man who told us what to replace capitalism with, but as someone who brilliantly pointed out certain of its problems. The School of Life, a pro-Capitalist institution, takes a look.  For books from The School of Life, visit our online shop:  https://goo.gl/O1tWri       



FURTHER READING

“Most people agree that we need to improve our economic system somehow. It threatens our planet through excessive consumption, distracts us with irrelevant advertising, leaves people hungry and without healthcare, and fuels unnecessary wars. Yet we’re also often keen to dismiss the ideas of its most famous and ambitious critic, Karl Marx. This isn’t very surprising. In practice, his political and economic ideas have been used to design disastrously planned economies and nasty dictatorships. Frankly, the remedies Marx proposed for the ills of the world now sound a bit demented. He thought we should abolish private property. People should not be allowed to own things. At certain moments one can sympathise. But it’s like wanting to ban gossip or forbid watching television. It’s going to war with human behaviour. And Marx believed the world would be put to rights by a dictatorship of the proletariat; which does not mean anything much today. Openly Marxist parties received a total of only 1,685 votes in the 2010 UK general election, out of the nearly 40 million ballots cast…”

The philosophy of Stoicism - Massimo Pigliucci,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-philosophy-of-stoicism-massimo-pigliucci

What is the best life we can live? How can we cope with whatever the universe throws at us and keep thriving nonetheless? The ancient Greco-Roman philosophy of Stoicism explains that while we may not always have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over how we approach things. Massimo Pigliucci describes the philosophy of Stoicism.

"J. Robert Oppenheimer: ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""","The profound moment when science met conscience. Step into the mind of the excellent physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who spoke these haunting words after witnessing the first successful test of the atomic bomb.

In a 1965 television broadcast discussing the aftermath of the Trinity Test, J. Robert Oppenheimer said, ""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent."" Recalling a verse from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita, where Vishnu assumes his multi-armed form to impress upon the price the gravity of his duty, stating, ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.""

The quote derives from the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu text containing 700 verses, dating back to the first millennium BCE. The scripture revolves around a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, an incarnation o the deity Vishnu. Arjuna grapples with reluctance to engage in a concept without an exact English equivalent. At one juncture in the scripture, Arjuna implores Krishna to reveal his divine form, often described as a ""multi-armed form.""

One translation of this moment in the text portrays what Arjuna witnesses as follows: ""If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.""

This vision of the suns going up into the sky helps understand why it may create thoughts of witnessing a nuclear explosion.

SKELETON BONES SONG - LEARN IN 3 MINUTES!!!,"HAPPY HALLOWEEN! Here's a song for you to memorize the bones in 3 minutes!

The skeleton has 2-0-6 bones in an adult,
Babies have 2-70, which fuse for this result.
The skeleton is divided into two main zones,
Which are called the axial and appendicular bones.
 
The axial skeleton is topped by the skull,
Your brain is in the cranium, which acts as a hull.
The mandible or jawbone is able to expand,
Which is useful for talking, as you can understand.
 
The ossicles are small bones, found inside your ear,
The maleus, incus, stapes, which all help you hear.
Sound waves are amplified by these three bones,
And then move to the cochlea, which discerns the tones!

The rib cage helps to protect the lungs and the heart,
With 12 ribs on each side, the sternum in the front.
Your vertebral column, made up of vertebrae,
Are stacked up very neatly, in a vertical array.
 
The cervical vertebrae make up your neck,
The spinal chord keeps your reflexes on deck!
The ribs are supported by thoracic vertebrae, 
Lumbar ones are at the end of the spinal cord pathway!
 
Five sacral vertebrae are fused to form your sacrum,
Which holds your upper body, and is found in your bum.
Below it is the coccyx, or the tailbone,
In humans the coccyx has not really grown.
 
The appendicular skeleton  - a  126  bones,
In shoulders, arms, and legs, as we have here shown,
Your scapula, also known, as your shoulder blade,
Next to the clavicle, or collarbone, is laid.
 
You have three arm bones, one above and two below,
Here they come together, to meet at the elbow.
The bones of the forearm are the ulna and the radius,
The humerus in the upper arm, so don’t you forget this.
 
You have 54 bones in one hand and one wrist,
Of carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges these consist.
The proximal, intermediate, and distal phalanges,
Make up your fingers, which you can move with ease.
 
Remember that your hands are where you find the carpals,
And the feet are where you will find all your tarsals.
The hip bone can be divided into three,
The ilium, ischium, and pubis, as you can see!
 
The bones in your leg? Well, there are four,
The patella is your kneecap, and then there are three more,
The tibia and fibula are found below the knee,
And the femur’s found above it, as we can all agree!
 
There are 52 bones, in your ankles and your feet,
Once you know the hand bones, these will be a treat!
There are the tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges,
Remember that they are proximal, intermediate, and distal!

The Infinite Hotel, a thought experiment created by German mathematician David Hilbert, is a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. Easy to comprehend, right?  Wrong. What if it's completely booked but one person wants to check in? What about 40? Or an infinitely full bus of people? Jeff Dekofsky solves these heady lodging issues using Hilbert's paradox.
