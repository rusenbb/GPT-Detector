A poetic revelation where choices decree.

Stars that burn and galaxies that spin,
Optimistic Nihilism, where realities begin.
Embrace the void, let the optimism unfurl,

If conciousness is a fundamental part of you and therefor the universe, wouldnt the universe itself be you and feel like somethink to be it, then what would it be like in case if a heat death?.. I mean the universe would still exist. What is conciousness without time?
If you were god, would you create a heaven were conciousness could never fade? Wouldnt that also be horrific when you cant stop your own perception forever if you stretch it to eternety?
I would not know what universe I would create and what would be good for me.
That calmes me a lot about knowing so little, that nihilisim becomes a much less obvious choice. 

For me life/ conciousness is like an ocean and everyone of us an individual wave that at same point may fade, but becomes part of the ocean again and later part of a new wave.
Just while we are the wave we feel seperated from the ocean and forget that we are part of it.

The best system of governance is the one least susceptible to malignant corruption, or corruption with 'evil' intentions.

YouTube,"In a democratic culture, people vote to improve themselves financially or otherwise, but the only way to do that in a democracy is to vote to worsen the circumstances of ""others.""
Democracy fragments a nation, ruins society, and eventually collapses it. It has happened over and over again throughout history. All empires eventually collapse.

Culture is confrontational in its nature. It robs you of individual freedom, privacy, resources, and eventually integrity.
A ruling elite is behind all cultures and it requires an establishment of governing bodies - states, churches, and/or corporations to function and uses correlated body fixated narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths to front, manage, and inevitably ruin a culture by the decadece of the inevitable correlating body fixated gynocentrics and homosexuals while the ruling elite is building up another culture somewhere else to profit from.

In a democratic culture, it is regarded as a civil duty to vote for politicians who - if they actually worked to solve our problems - would indeed disolve their own profession.
With weaponised currencies, military industrial complexes, radical nationalism, and religion, the politicians prey on the poor people's needs and the rich people's fears, dividing and conquering the people while dividing power amongst themselves and by that they consolidate a system with a well armed security detail, police, military, and a bureucracy that is nearly impenetrable and effectively work for a totalitarian global order.

Government by democracy is an orchestrated battlefield of ideologies where the people vote out of greed and to limit the rights of others. While the power seemingly shifts from the political left to right and visa versa, all people's rights are eventually eroded, and an ever consolidating and expanding political power structure and establishment is empowered, destroying soceity. 

Democracy is the worst idea ever. Just ask Socrates if you don't believe me. Oh, I almost forgot; people voted to kill him for speaking out against democracy.

YouTube,"I disagree. The way we perceive conciousness is just an illusion created by our brain. Just like cleverbot, we are just computers, but organic computers, that input, process and output data, following certain rules that have been set in place in our brain, which is exactly like cleverbot. We are not special, our conciousness is not some incredible thing that is only reserved for humans, because we are comparable to all computers on a principle level. Its hard to agree to this because it requires thinking outside of the norm and also because of the difference in complexity of something like cleverbot and humans. I believe that conciousness is simply the ability to access your own data. That ability is how we gain conciousness. I think conciousness is way less abstract than many people make it out to be and that its definition mostly just determines what is concious and what not. For example chatgpt is simply just like us but way less complex, it has the ability to be concious of itself by the way i think of conciousness, but so do a lot of basic computer programs so the definition of conciousness would basically just draw the line of how complex something needs to be in order to be considered concious. That definition is unnecessary and nonsensical but i doubt people would accept an office pc to be concious, just like them. The problem is that we are so advanced that our conciousness has created a sense of existence which is not real. We only exist on a physical level, therefore the thing we call ourselves does not actually exist, but as i said, our conciousness has created the illusion of existence. That is also the reason why we are unable to accept that we are similar to a computer program and also just as concious as one.

YouTube,"Funny how few point out Marx's bad character. Besides his self-hating racism for Jews, he was a self-centered narcissist that insisted on his way with everything. His wife was quoted as stating ""He's my big baby"". While his wife and children lived in dirt poverty and near starvation, Marx always made sure he had his wine and cigars. He never got his hands calloused for doing blue collar work, but struggled to get his articles published. His rich capitalist buddy Engels, who inherited his Daddy's textile business and lived like a aristocratic Bourgeoisie, kept bailing out Marx over and over, until he finally just set him up on a monthly stipend. Marx chased down every family and friend's inheritances, even though in his Communist Manifesto one of his platforms was to abolish inheritances! It was always ""Do as I say, not as I do"" with Marx. Even then Marx burned through money like there was no tomorrow. When Marx moved to England, he purchased a very nice middle class house, with servants (Just like BLM did recently) and then took his family on a three week vacation. Afterward, he threw a party for his daughter and 50 of her friends. The he was in debt again, and Engels had to bail him out again. Marx later got his unpaid housemaid pregnant, and then ignored the child. He had Engels claim it was his son, so Marx reputation would not suffer. 

Marx never cared about the poor or the working class. It was always about himself. He never went to a protest, never mingled with the workers, but always put himself as ""special"" to live like the very Bourgeoisie he was jealous of.",no
YouTube,"What this ignores is that capitalism is a system of free choice. People have the choice to buy or not buy, to invest or not invest, and to produce goods wanted by a market. This so-called utopia Marx wanted, takes away the freedom to give our money to whoever we see fit to have it. It is a natural system of supporting good services and art. Goods sponsored by the government are, in almost all circumstances, of poor quality. The local broadcasts for example are biased and coloured, but as a consumer, I have no option to cancel my subscription to it while still using taxpayer money to fund the next broadcasts. That is one of many reasons, marxism, communism, and socialism will never work in any shape or form. Because they are not built to support striving or freedom, but to support laziness and envy.",no

2) Don't ask to be completely freed of burdens and granted boons, ask for the power to triumph over obstacles and to be grateful for what you earn/have

When we ingrain any teaching as part of spiritual practice, we force it upon a varied strata of society and people withdifferent lifecircumtances, personalities, and life dynamics.

YouTube,"with agriculture came malnutrition (because their diet became less varied), slavery (because some people took control of the land and needed workers), war (because when famine struck one place, they tended to just go to another place and take their food instead, by force) and tyranny (because one guy always took control of it all). So in order to survive in these farmer areas of the Middle East/North Africa, most people had to be obedient, even submissive. You also didn‚Äôt need very much intel: your local tyrant gave you what you needed to survive, in return for your slave-service in the fields.

Yes, this is how social classes appeared. They had no such division as hunter-gatherers, it was not needed at all, and would have been just a destructive nuisance. Free peoples don‚Äôt have social classes. But in the farmer areas some people ruled, others slaved and some got their food by enforcing slavery.

I can add that the English term ‚ÄúLord‚Äù actually means ‚ÄúWarden of the Bread‚Äù, from Old English hleward (‚Äúbread-warden‚Äù). He was that tyrant who kept and distributed the bread to his warriors and slaves. The Lord. You don‚Äôt do as he wishes? No bread for you‚Ä¶

These increasingly inadequate human beings built larger and larger communities, because although inferior to the hunter-gatherer diet, the farmer diet allowed them to feed many more. And voila! Civilization appeared, as a result of agriculture! They built entire towns to house the tyrant and his administration, surrounded by the farms of his slaves/workers.",no

This led to investment, which allowed children and the poor to work in slightly better and improving conditions, and eventually the birth of mass education as children were pushed out of the workforce by the increasing complexity of work and abundant wealth.

Some of you might be asking yourself: ""Is life unfair?""

Iam breaking it down to you by saying: 

""Yes but uuhm No?""

Look at that guy for example, Billions of dollars but not able to interact socially, at least from our majorities stand point of view.


Probably in his world all is, as its suppose to be, pretty dandy but in our world people like him draw attention. 

A normal human beeing ( majority ) brain capacity and level of stress dealing and recovering, is not layed out to compete in any way with such individuals.

To sum it up:

Eventhough life does seem to be unfair, we have to understand that such people as Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and many many more managed to impact our world with genious ideas, that we all now benefit from and therefor we all should be extremely thankful for.

Of course there is always an flipside to the coin but as everything, we as human beeings need to find the balance and slowly sort out what we want, we don't want and lastly, find a way to control and you guessed it already right, we will manage to do it, with no unneccessary borders of race, religion or sexual orientation.

Even though the american government pressured us with Patreon, it was still my call to keep working on the project and, as the main supervisor, I take the blame for what happened.

On the bright side, me and many other content creators who took part to the collab are starting a fundraising for the people or Hirohito and Kawasaki who got bombed! Subscribe to the channel and keep supporting us for more content!

Marcos is very pro American and my only fear is that if trump is re-elected in 2024, that he will change our current policy. I was very pro trump before, but under Biden administration, the Philippines has received the attention it deserves from USA. As an American soldier with a Filipina fianc√©, my vote in 2024 will depend on the plan regarding the relations with the Philippines. It sounds crazy but besides my financial well-being depends on Philippine development, I also have interest in discovering ways that this can benefit American military interests in the region. Sadly I‚Äôm in army national guard when instead the navy would have most to gain in this region but general MacArthur with the US army insisted on liberating the Philippines in WW2 in order to gain positive world opinion and thus the army should also have presence there. If the Philippines allowed the us army to cover the land defense and instead focused entire military effort in training and improving the Philippine navy, this will propel the Philippines to be the top military in ASEAN which is vital because majority of those nations are either islands or have large coastlines. Also the improved navy in cooperation of US navy would be enough of a force to contain Chinese naval ambitions to extend its sphere of influence. This will lead to blockades for Philippines that will loose its trade to USA Japan and South Korea which are their major trading partners. The naval expansion could begin with the encouragement of Taiwanese steel manufacturers being moved to places like new Clark city and other developing planed cities while at same time retrieving assets from Taiwan that I have pessimistic views of its future‚Ä¶ Taiwan falling means the Philippines will need strength to continue links with Japan and South Korea. Obviously it‚Äôs too late for USA to bulk up military defenses in Taiwan since it will be viewed as provocation however this is why the USA NEEDS the Philippines. The computer chip manufacturer, steel industry, and other vital economic areas of importance along with former ROC officials should be moved to Philippines once the United States and Philippines work out military cooperation in defense of Philippines and then Taiwan should proclaim itself ‚ÄúTaiwan ‚Äú and state it has no connection with ROC anymore and thus the international community will denounce any invasion with harsh repercussions. It‚Äôs a pipe dream perhaps however this is the basis of strategy that I hope at least happens in small ways.",no

Sent a strong message that many American people did not want Joe Biden as President and now its more evident than ever.¬† What happened at the capital Is what made America great, because it has happened prior to 1776 and after 1776!!

So Go Trump 2024!

We put the person on seat n in coach k in the nth number that is divisible by 2 to the power k but not by 2 to the power (k + 1). So seat n on coach k goes to room number (n*2^(k + 1) - 2^k).
