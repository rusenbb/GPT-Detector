       " 'A vow of celibacy \\nand the relinquishment of all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice.Considering the \\npoverty from which he had come and the sexual horrors he had endured in prison, \\ncelibacy was a welcome change.',\n",
       " \"She was afraid his \\nexplanation would be more terrifying than the incident itself.Incredibly, Saunière had never given up on her, and Sophie now possessed a \\ndecade's worth of correspondence unopened in a dresser drawer.To her grandfather's \\ncredit, he had never once disobeyed her request and phoned her.\",\n",
       " \"Now, standing in the darkness of the Louvre men's room, Sophie could hear the \\nechoes of this afternoon's phone message.Sophie, we both may be in danger.Call me.\",\n",
