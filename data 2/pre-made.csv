Farmers are demanding an increase of up to 25% in their prices to cover costs. The EU is the world's largest milk producer and nearly 47% of its 123bn euro budget went on subsidies and other forms of financial aid for farmers, including dairy producers in 2010.",no

We hold that the Commission did not make a prima facie case of discrimination in its findings of fact, and that it must, therefore, remand the case to the New York Court of Appeals with instructions to set aside the Commission's findings of fact and to set aside the Commission's order of sale in the absence of any showing of discriminatory purpose.",no

PDF,"In my opinion, the Court's interpretation of Section 3 raises significant constitutional concerns. If an employee is denied any review of the Board's decision when the railroad wins, while the latter can obtain judicial review and a jury trial before complying with a Board order, it seems to create an unjustifiable discrimination that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Allowing one party in a lawsuit two opportunities to succeed while the other party has only one, or permitting one party to have a jury determine their case while the other cannot, is not a common practice in the United States.

The early evidence from Yellowstone's past shows that the forces that drive these rare and violent events can move much more rapidly than volcanologists previously anticipated. If the supervolcano underneath Yellowstone erupts again, we may have far less advance warning time than we thought. The magma reservoir that feeds the supervolcano is about two and a half times larger than previous estimates, and it seems the magma can rapidly refresh—making the volcano potentially explosive in the geologic blink of an eye.
