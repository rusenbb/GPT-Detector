YouTube,"It's isn't work ethic that drives them to over work, it is fear. Fear, shame and guilt are all the fundamental aspects of Japanese society. They feel guilty for taking a paid vacation because they know that their colleagues would be working and they are fearful that the whole company would be resentful of that one individual that chooses to take the day off or leave work early. They are not actually working to finish work, they work to create more work so they don't ever have to finish working.

YouTube,"I worked for a bank in Tokyo, and yes they work long hours but it was rarely working hard. A lot is due to the culture of hierarchy & saving 'face'. For example, we were told never to leave the office before your boss. A bit of an issue when you finished your work by 4pm and your boss is still there till 10pm! You have to find ways to occupy yourselves for those 6 hours. So on paper I worked a 14 hour day but in reality there was maybe only a few hours of actual productive stuff done. 

Another thing was endless meetings, worse than anything I've seen in the US or UK. And meetings are rarely productive due to the face saving aspect - it's generally bad etiquette to disagree strongly with someone in a meeting in front of others even if their ideas are terrible.

The average Japanese salaryman also drinks extremely heavily. We would typically go out for dinner with our team 4 nights per week & we'd all get drunk - so most days a significant amount of staff are nursing hangovers. Again due to the hierarchy culture you can't really say no if your boss invites you out for dinner, which ends up being almost every night.

YouTube,"When the enclosures of the commons took place in England, i think that the changing of people's mindsets towards a capitalist one was essentially a forceful assimilation in order to survive. The commons were lands that anyone could use to take their cattle to graze upon, pick berries or herbs (whatever may have grown - not sure if would just be wild or if people would plant stuff there too), chop wood for fire, (and particularly for women, the commons was an important social space of meeting and working together), helping each other out etc. The enclosures of the commons privatised that land, removed all the social and economic activity that was a part of the commons, and forced those people, who were mostly peasants (not meant derogatorily), to survive by making money (or more of it than before). With the commons taken away, i think pretty much the only way for most peasants or lower-class people to survive was to go and work in the new, industrial factories (or mines/other industrial labour) - in order to make a wage, this wage being now the only way that people could live.I'm not the first to argue that this change of culture was a violent process, as it removed people from the land - though i'm not saying that everything about peasant life is good of course. But it took away people's ability to be more self-sustaining, and forced them to work for most hours of the day doing repetitive, draining, often dangerous forms of labour (as mentioned in the video), that brought them very little fulfilment (beyond being paid and just surviving on that payment, but I wouldn't call that fulfilling) and, I would argue, made them much more oppressed by their new employers.",no

YouTube,So funny and informative too. I remember learning in school about the concepts of Capitalism and Socialism. I understood them as only being concepts of a set of policies a government is using in governance rather than those 2 concepts being the concept of any other kind of overarching basic human belief system of the kind that the hoarders and liars named Ananias and Safira who said that they believed in too along with Christianity while their community was pooling all profits into one fund which can be called a kind of communism. Somehow my understanding of the 2 didn't help me get a higher than average mark in social studies for a femal student compared to a male student but thats O.K. I never wanted to be a social scientist or lawyer anyway and besides I didn't want to hide anything like property and I didn't need a higher mark to get into any post secondary program of study except for maybe a secular program to study law which I have no desire to work in anyway. That was in the early 1970's when highschool career counsellors were often advising female students to not bother taking any highschool course in Calculus because according to them most of us who wanted to learn how to be a nurse of whatever didn't need to know it anyway. Interesting that today a farmer's wife no matter how hard she works on the farm in a divorce will still only have rights to the home quarter from all the land on her farm. In a way that is a sort of a choice between a one way street communism or one way street feudalism if things don't work out for the wife because her husband's beard was hiding more than she bargained for. A farmer's wirfe is always being governed by one man who owns the land which she is living on -- If it wasn't for -- You guessed it: Socialism while she is making a daring escape from life on that farm.,no

Also pathetic how it seems you all only look for the proponents for Marxism, perspectives that will only and obviously praise it, rather than study the reasons why many are against it. What good is an unrivaled belief besides indoctrination?

YouTube,"ANUPAM CHAKRABORTY I do know the bad effects of of an aggressive capitalist economy, and I do agree that Marxism did help establish safer work environments, but it that’s the most it will ever do. Quit playing victim. You know, Seattle was going to start taxing Amazon more and because of that, they were going to take their HQ elsewhere. Seattle apologized and didn’t tax them. Now that Bezos announced a second HQ, cities all over the US are begging him to build their with incentives of taxpayers’ billions to him if he does. Heck, a city was even willing to rename itself “Amazon” if he built it there. I wonder why billionaires have so much power. Maybe it’s the government who’s always on the hunt for money. And if the government is willing to do that, imagine a socialist state where the only people with actual power are government officials. It’s only natural for those with power to abuse it, especially politically. Also, though unions provide a decent protection for workers, most union workers don’t even want it. There’s a reason why their dubbed the union mafia, “pay us and we’ll protect you!” That’s their slogan right? Sounds like a government. Now that I think about it, the government sounds like a mafia. Oh, and if it sounds like I’m defending Bezos, I am. Though I don’t believe it was right for him to evade taxes, he deserves to be rich. He worked McDonald’s, then started an online business in the 90s that sold books. How boring, but hey, he poured time and effort and it worked. But tax him to death? Here’s what happens when you vote for more taxes; we all pay 50%, but the rich are smart, and just like Bezos, they’ll hire someone even smarter to help advise them to legally evade taxes, then guess what, is peasants are now stuck with a 50% tax. Point is, the US doesn’t have the gold standard anymore, we’re on a fiat currency, meaning money is always printing. You want some wealth, go get it. Stop reforming to Marxism to make you “live comfortably” and be somebody. We can still get rich, just like Bezos, just like Gates, just like Jobs.

YouTube,"ANUPAM CHAKRABORTY a lot. Some good, most bad. Honestly too many to list and maybe a lot more I’m unaware of,  and though they may have good intentions and have helped some, it has made people fragile and unable. Worst one I know is that there’s a general relief fund that helps the homeless. In LA, there’s a lot and you’d think it helps them, but they openly admit to using their funds to purchase meth and other drugs. Then there’s the political side in where if they don’t pass out the budget, politicians will use it to reward themselves. I also remember once at the grocery store I use to work at there was this old lady who didn’t buy much and paid cash. Behind her was a muscular man who clearly ate well with a full cart of expensive steaks and name brand food. Didn’t look like he had any children since I couldn’t find any milk, baby food, or even foods for children and probably bought them to support his muscles. He used a food stamp card. My aunt, who had a 3 year old son at the time only qualified for $15. She’s not the only mother. These are the socialist ideas that we have unfortunately implemented. I understand being an absolute capitalist country will have its flaws too, but seeing the abuse and misdistribution of money really makes me angry. I can forgive a corrupted businessman, it’s sometimes necessary to thrive in a cutthroat world, but I can not forgive a corrupted politician/government because they essentially sworn an oath and gained the trust of the people to serve the people. All I see are them collecting checks and bribes. Ever wonder how a politician, who’s salary of $200,000 a year retire as multimillionaires?",no
YouTube, @TotalConcentration0  proper distribution of wealth is a major step to gain a sustainable development ... I live in India ( Kolkata city) and being a citizen of a developing nation with a higher corruption rate sustainable development ( I think u know the meaning) can be achieved only through implementation of grassroot level social security  projects like health education and food security... I know ur from a developed country...and ur perspective of social security is far different from us...but think about the poorest of the poorest people with a daily income less than half dollar ( not only in India but also the other nations) to provide them at least an opportunity to play in the same field robust implimentation  social security  projects is the best way...,no
YouTube,"ANUPAM CHAKRABORTY I have thought about the poor countries. I still strongly believe that a free market would be best. I will be honest, developed countries like the US have made it hard for your people by installing factories and sending donations there. Don’t take it the wrong way, but take a look at countries in Africa. One country has 200+ shoe making companies. Each one employs an average of 15 people. Tom’s Shoes, the American shoe brand, promotes itself saying that with every pair bought, one is donated to Africa. Can you imagine what 2 million shoes can do to those businesses in Africa? You can’t beat free so those shoe businesses go out of business or let go of workers, leaving Africa poor and unable to prosper. Now imagine that with the clothing factories in poor countries. People in India makes clothes for people to buy to make a living and eat, but have no customers because the US sends old clothes as donations, distorting the economy there. Finally, imagine that with social security. That’s how I view social security. The government or social security can help all they want, but true success comes not just from within, but as a community that will help each other thrive. I do agree that social security projects are a good thing and to a very small extent and for a proper limited time, should be given out, I just can’t see it happening. Also, as you said, proper distribution, but I don’t think anyone, even myself, have the resistance to do anything proper and uphold it for a long time. It’s just human nature. So even if help was given out, will it truly help people prosper and will it be unadulterated?",no
YouTube, @TotalConcentration0  I don't know about ur knowledge about textile industry of India...but I do know it's time to update ur knowledge base....and what u have said about human nature - that's called GREED.... And we all know that greed is a bad think... don't u think so...from the beginning of the society the cumulative effort helps to transform us as we have seen now... Now from the past 100 years our population has increased several times...and to support that growth we have planned many policies... And those policies creates a world full of discriminatory principals which simultaneously creates a privileged and an underprivileged class....now we live in different geopolitical era we have to think differently... think about sustainable development....,no
YouTube,"ANUPAM CHAKRABORTY I think even I knew I was talking about greed. Point I was trying to make so that you know it’s in all of us, meaning that it doesn’t matter who’s in charge, government-controlled handouts or anything are a way to launder money. And no, I don’t think everyone fully understands greed, or there wouldn’t be liberal proponents of big government. Also, your talk of discrimination and the privileged and unprivileged may have more to do with government than big businesses than you might think. And you’re somewhat right about sustainable development, but we shouldn’t pamper the future like how we shouldn’t pamper the people now. It’s like Aesop’s fable of the Monkey and her children. The one who was spoiled dies because he was smothered with love while it’s twin thrives, reaching maturity, through neglect and hardship. By the way, Aesop was most likely a slave by historical records and this story shows he doesn’t play victim. Maybe you shouldn’t too.",no

YouTube,The man was incredible. He changed the world.,no
YouTube,"I personally think Steve Jobs carried a lot of pain inside due to  being abandoned  by his parents , or rather let me say not wanted  by them . The couple that did adopt him were very fine and loving people .  However the knowledge of being an unwanted baby  I feel was a major propelling  factor in his life .  It was also the source of his anger his meanness and his frustrations.
 Steve Jobs was a very complex man . He proved to be a good husband and a very loving father to all his children , even to the beautiful little girl he would not acknowledge for 10 years .  The point is he finally did and he loved and embraced her completely .  He was a marketing genius and a  true visionary .  R.I.P.  Steve Jobs . 
Steve Jobs together with Steve Wozniak , a genius of another kind ,created History .",no

YouTube,"One of Jobs' greatest strengths was to be able to see a different reality, the one he envisioned vs the one that existed.  For example, he thought of products we didn't even know we needed. This belief may have cost him his life as he refused to be operated on when his tumor was, accordingly to Issacson, ""curable"". He waited too long and only agreed after it was clear that his reality, addressing the illness with diet and alternative therapies, was doomed to fail. Tragically, it was too late

It was one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read. I had a hard time putting it down.

I can certainly appreciate Jobs’ genius - I have owned a lot of Apple products over the years and love them. I am typing this comment on my iPad and I don’t know how I ever lived without it - I am on it probably 3 to 4 hours a day.

However, I would never have wanted to work for Steve Jobs. I think the issue with Jobs as a manager is that he is so brilliant that he gets impatient with people he considers inferior to him in terms of intelligence and doesn’t know how to relate to them. 

Sorry he left the world at such a relatively young age and it didn’t have to happen the way it did. Again, I think that Jobs believed he knew more than the doctors who treated him and therefor delayed the surgery that could have prolonged his life. But that was his call and he paid the price for his decision.",no

YouTube, @robcall5182  from my understanding it was microsoft who saved apple. jobs reached out to gates and because the office product did well on macs - gates provided some seed money to keep them afloat. they were also friends so im sure it was a gesture of friendship somewhat. theres a press conference  that apple did where jobs had bill gates on video conferncing saying that apple wouldve died without him. people booed at first because apple people hated windows. heres that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOp5mBY9IY,no

YouTube,"The one thing I struggled with was how you can ""borrow"" shares and sell them, and this video covers it VERY briefly, but more thoroughly than any other source I've found. Basically it's like taking out a loan but in the form of shares, as I understand it",no
YouTube,Finally I understand how a short works! Great job keeping it simple. Thanks you so much!,no
YouTube,"Great information as always, I never quite understood the process of going short until now.  If I may make a request for a future video that I struggle to find simplistic information on, the methodologies of calculating the value of a company and hence its stock price.  In order to work out what would be an ideal price to look for when attempting the paradoxically impossible task of buying low.",no
YouTube,The dividend pay-forward being characterised initially as a cost would confuse people. The reason you pay out a dividend to the stock lender is because your short position value increases 1:1 with the required dividend payout. Thus it isn't a cost but merely a value exchange (they get the dividend from you but you get a higher value short position as the stock decreases),no
YouTube,"The main thing this video sadly does not cover is shorting bonds, which is much, much, much more common than shorting stock due to their capped upside and is basically one of the most important things that banks do to lend money to companies while capping their risk (for example, shorting company A's bonds, to lend money to company B that has company A as their only customer, and pocketing the difference in yield).

Similarly, the AAA-ranked mortgage-backed securities in the big short were bond-like securities that normally have very little volatility, have capped upside, are easy to borrow for shorting, any only had a few % yield over T bonds so that shorting them would only cost you a couple % of your investment each year at low risk, but had a huge payoff in the event of a default.",no
YouTube,"This channel is one of the best in its kind. I just spent months going through a lot of videos to have a better understanding of finance, and your videos are clear, relatively short without being too short, and give great explanations about diverse subjects. Thank you for this great content, hope you'll keep making those.",no
YouTube,"Something interesting to note is that you can short financial assets without the associated costs using derivatives such as CFDs. This also comes at a large amount of risk however, as CFDs utilise large amounts of leverage. The  'stop loss' feature comes with gap risk. There are also Put Options in which you can only lose the premium you pay initially.",no
YouTube,This explained it really well. I always had a hard time understanding the leveraged position part but this cleared it up for me.,no
YouTube,I knew some of the pitfalls of shorting but this video really helps clarify them.  Shorting can work for day and swing trading but is dangerous for core trading.  Any time you short have a stop loss and don't move it.,no
YouTube,"Great video. This is why I went with SPXU, leveraged inverse ETF. The market rallied unexpectedly before it crashed. But I was able to ride it out indefinitely even though I was down 30% at one point. Plus, the S&P 500 can only rise or fall a limited amount.",no
YouTube,"Great explanation. I love the detailed perspectives and the examples given. :)
My observations have been that short-sellers are always on the edge of things: any announcement/news might send them in a ""panic"" move. Often, in margin trading, the house is always the winner because it not only collects fees and interest payments, but it can also liquidate your position through collusion with other (bigger) investors at any time.
All in all, short selling is a strategy that works only for a certain amount of time, mostly to get money/liquidity quickly. Going long and diversifying do offer more sustainable ways to grow your capital.",no

YouTube,NONE!! unless you can explain why a brokerage firm is allowed to lend out someone else's stock without asking. There are companies that will not allow a brokerage firm to do this since it multiplies outstanding stock by the amount of the short. As much as some would like to justify the action of shorting stock it's actually quite immorality unless it can be explained another way.,no

I had called my Bank to attempt to set up feature for short selling (As it seems like it requires certain qualifications and standards) but unfortunately for me I was Denied. No reason stated why but I do know I don’t have the BEST Credit History in the world. 

Q: Can your credit score prevent you from having the ability to Short Sell Stocks ?

In my knowledge there is nothing that humans fear more than to think ""too much"" and also to see their own flaws. Anyone who dares to be reflective is deemed either as boring, foolish and weak, or (like Socrates) ""dangerous"", or (like Nietzche) crazy AND DANGEROUS.
The dictatorship of superficiality!
Well also, Qualified vote is wonderful conceptually but dangerous in practice, too. Humans are only an animal species full of fears and griddyness. Even the most Utopic ideas can be turned into hell by the innate corruption and manipulation that arises from our primitive, fearful and mortal condition. Wishing the enlightment of all humanity is a utopic dream which, at 36 years old, I start to feel is as impossible as accomplishing the mormon heaven. Still, we can keep trying to make things better, recalling though that Socrates lived more than 2000 years ago, and the human mind has not changed much ever since.

One other thing to note about Socrates: He taught that making mistakes, perceiving one's own mistakes, correcting one's own mistakes, and thus improving one's knowledge and wisdom by productively utilising lessons learned when correcting one's own mistakes, is a valuable and NECESSARY part of Life and SHOULD NEVER BE HELD AGAINST THE PERSON CORRECTING HER/HIS MISTAKES.

I found lots of things in this lecture impressive and amazing (sorry, words can't explain this well enough).
First, Professor Michael Sandel takes all ideas from his students seriously. I definitely wanna take his course at least once in my life. Thanks to him, I became much more interested in philosophy and ethics. I came to enjoy thinking. I can feel that he values and adores philosophy.
Second, students are very active and participating, eager to learn and gain knowledge, and also witty. In Japan, it is said that 50 percent of high schoolers enroll in university, but in most cases, they don't actually want to study. They just want friends, someone to love, and things like that. I mean, it's so horrible that most of those students go to university just because everyone else does. Of course, I have never attended a class in a Japanese university, but in both my elementary and middle school, I noticed that everyone remained quiet and hardly spoke. I always feel uncomfortable in a situation like that. But in Harvard, they have their own thoughts and are open to sharing them with others.
I profoundly want to study in this kind of environment.

YouTube,"Hi Kurzgesagt,

I'm a PhD student in Clinical Psychology researching existential nihilism, and have cited this video in my most recent scientific publication where we invented a tool to measure existential nihilism. It is such a fascinating worldview that is quite popular among people. For example, approximately 1 in 6 North American participants and 1 in 10 Canadian undergraduate participants endorsed nihilistic beliefs in each of my study's samples, respectively.

While my research team and I haven't yet investigated whether the link between nihilism and wellbeing is moderated by optimism or pessimism like you suggest in your video, we did find that existential nihilism was significantly related to depression, unfavourable affect profiles (i.e., high negative emotion and low positive emotions), and life dissatisfaction in both of our samples. 

For anyone interested, you can find my most recent published research on existential nihilism on Google Scholar by typing in ""The Existential Nihilism Scale (ENS): Theory, Development, and Psychometric Evaluation.""

 14 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;

15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.

16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.

17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

Like, every time something significantly changes in us, for example after a sleep, our consciousness updates, we are not the same person as the day before, but we link to our previous self by the means of memory.

YouTube,"Interesting questions. I personally think that consciousness is not physical, or maybe not even a specific ""subject"". We can have split counciousness in one brain (multiple personality disorders). Its perception, its memories, experiences, and choices made based on them that eventually creates or develops self awareness. Why we dont remember the moment we were born? we had not enough memories or experiences to develop a consiousness. Another question is, can we ""merge"" consiousness? if we somehow could ""inject"" someone else's memories and adapt the same brain cells conections to feel the same nostalgia and feel thst we lived those experiences, would we still be ourselves or would we become something else? Remember, its only my humble opinion",no

YouTube,"The thing many people miss whilst observing Stoicism is that it doesn't follow the typical standards of positive thinking that are pushed in today's philosophy. The philosophy of today would have you think that you should remain positive at all times with no exception. That differs greatly from how Stoicism works.

For example, Marcus Aurelius would practice something called Negative Visualization for a short time in the morning. He would think of all that could go wrong in the day, what he would do to remedy each problem, and after this allotted time, he would move on from it and go about his day not thinking about it unless something actually went wrong. If something did go wrong, he was already prepared for it and could better remedy the situation. This is not to say he was a negative person. He was just better prepared to handle negative impacts if they happened.

This is where the problem of positive thinking at all times is understood. If you do not prepare yourself, you are more susceptible to the weight of a negative situation being greater than if you had already been prepared for it. This is why so many people become depressed and their world stops. They don't have the necessary coping skills built in. (I'm not saying it's the whole reason people become depressed. Just giving an out for some of that stress of hard situations)",no

YouTube,"Stoicism, by itself anyway, is too dull. It will give you a senseless life. 
The emotions that make you lose control, like anger, are intrinsically undesirable in Stoicism. 
It is preferable to adopt the philosophy, or rather the theology, of the cross as did the ancient Christan martyrs singing hymns joyfully while being thorn apart by wild beasts in Rome. 
In this system, emotions are able to blaze along side each other in harmony and peace of Christ Crucified. 
In torture, the Stoic will attempt to ignore the suffering underwent in the moment, which will create conflict in the soul, such is the method of the Stoic disciple. 
Whereas the disciple who has for master Christ Crucified will on the contrary enjoy his suffering in the spirit of penance for sins, it is here that the emotions blaze and confuse even those who torture, it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.

From a psychological perspective, it is not preferable, it is better to be a convinced Stoic than a deluded Christian. 
Since the Christian formula requires total adherence, Jesus says pick up your cross, the necessity of believing in the efficiency of the theology is too great to pass by delusion. 
You cannot delude yourself to be a perpetual silent and content victim, there is no high like a jihadi relief where you feel better because you've resolved to die in suicide and get 72 virgins in paradise, the Christian experience has no worldy anchor, Heaven is all about relationships gravitating around friendship with God.

They can launch all their own payloads at cost, and have a massive profit margin on customer launches by simply undercutting the competition by as much as they feel they need to.

The one danger from a strategic national perspective is that they might simply put most of their competition out of business putting all the launch eggs in one basket.

I was trying to find an elevator out of the infinitely many that was at least close to floor 1, but after looking for like 2 hours, the closest one I could find was at floor 5.63 octillion, and the one I was standing next to was at floor 5.68 x 10^178, which was actually relatively close. The hotel tried to fix this problem by making the elevators go at the speed of light, the highest possible speed, but even that won't get you that one elevator that's stuck at 5.63 octillion. So, of course I had to take the stairs..... and as I get there, the manager told me to move to two to the power of my room number which was uh.... room number 1.98 x 10^301030 (according to wolfram alpha).

I said I guessed it had something to do with enriching the earth or some such thing, but my therapist stopped me. ""No,"" he said, ""the purpose of a flower is to be a flower.""

It empowered me to accept my depression instead of feeling guilty or shaming myself for feeling the way I did. It empowered me to go and find help because I realized I couldn't fix it myself.

YouTube," @davidwilliams454  Very well, then.  In place of King and Keller, select any two atheists you care to who chose to give meaning to their lives by choosing to fight rather than passively submit to evil circumstances that were imposed upon them.  And realize this:  A person being herded into a gas chamber at a concentration camp could choose to passively walk into the chamber like a bleating sheep or he could choose to pick a rock up off the ground and assault a guard with the intent to bash his skull in.  The one who chooses to assault a guard instantly transforms himself from a contemptible victim into a heroic freedom fighter.  The one who chooses to assault a guard will be riddled with bullets in seconds, but, he will die fighting.  In choosing to die fighting, he will have chosen his own adventure to achieve existential meaning and purpose in his life.",no

YouTube,free roam mode,no
YouTube, @davidwilliams454  Beautiful words.,no
YouTube," @davidwilliams454  That's not how an existentialist would think. Existentialism is based on the acceptation that there is no objective meaning at all, which is the first option you mention. Deciding to create a subjective purpose means no conflict with such notion. They acknowledge that their subjective purpose has no real meaning in any way and that they have created it just for their own enjoyment of their existence. 

""If dreams can't come true, then why not pretend?""... but it's not real pretention. Under the strict definition of the word, you pretend in order to deceive, to project a false reality through appearance. An existentialist won't do it with that in mind, but just taking all what he seems to have (his life) and just living, finally free from external ideological impositions. 

It's just a stoic stance with a vitalist attitude. Another version of Nietzche's übermensch: killing god (external ideologies) and living guided by your own will to power. Positive nihilism. Absurdism. Understanding our absolute futility, yet living life at its fullest. That's the opposite of pretending.",no
YouTube," @davidwilliams454  That's an useless reflection. Obviously we will always be biased, beginning with our own senses, so even in an absurd situation where we lived completely alone, we would be heavily biased. We can't even rule out solipsism. That's a possibility, but it certainly is a waste of time to live as if that was a real limitation. It wouldn't be functional. Everything you said applies way more to other life conceptions, like religious ones (along many many others). Those are way more about what ""someone else tells us"". And, as you said, what is the use of making such a critique if almost anything we learn is through other people? That's a very weak critique, as it applies to any other philosophy (and in a much more direct way). The philosophies I named, which have what I discuss in common, are of course much less biased regarding that. They are more sincere. 

About what I truly believe... I'm quite convinced there is no such a thing as free will or as an actual consciousness. I see those elements as mere ilussions. I think that what we mean with ""sentient beings"" doesn't really exist and never will. But it's quite a nice illusion. I might not actually believe in what they say and, probably, most of the philosophers who developed the trends I quoted would kind of hate me... but, from a pragmatic point of view, I think that's by far the most sincere and enjoyable way to live. Well, it's not even a way to live, as it allows many different possibilities, but more like a way to understand our relationship with our own existence.

Now, even if that last paragraph wasn't true (which would be frankly great hahaha), ""meaning"" and ""purpose"" are merely human concepts, constructs that only exist inside our minds. Of course they don't actually exist, they are always subjective ideas. There is no actual telos. As a biologist, I can see that mistake continuously applied to the understanding of the evolutionary process. Adaptions arising in order tu fulfill a certain function. That's not how it works. Taking it as a priori element instead of a posteriori concept (which is what it actually is). I am making the same point, but applied to our motivations to live. That evolutionary conception is usually referred to as ""panglossian paradigm"" and the authors Gould and Lewontin make a good critique against it. It would be quite similar to the point I'm making in this paragraph (but applied to the evolutionary theory, of course). Clearly, there is no factual proof that such teleological tendency doesn't exist. You might know how difficult it is to test that something doesn't actually exist, much more if it's a complicated concept that we only know as a social construct. The burden of proof falls on your side. But then, again, I would think that something as convenient wouldn't be true. How convenient would it be for intelligent beings who are in profound existential pain caused by their apparent futility to find an external objective meaning that could give some kind of trascendence to their existence. How pleasant it is to think that all that suffering had an actual reason to be. But, sadly, reality is independent from our desires and our pain. It doesn't care. We are able to care about each other, though. If most people understood that, how much better our existence could be...",no
YouTube," @davidwilliams454  I don't reject the supernatural as an Atheist. I simply don't believe in it. If you were to show me God(s) are real, I'd convert to whatever religion the deities are from within a heartbeat.",no
YouTube, @davidwilliams454  Perhaps @erigor11 read a bit about Toltec stuffs.,no

If theists can believe something exists without any proof that said things exist, then, we'll literally have billions flooding into whatever religion that being is from, because, well, he can say their gods are all fake, and they can't disprove it. Also, bold of you to assume that I'd get swiped right. Also, I'd doubt he'll be able to solve everyone's problem. If the population was out a million, maybe, but it's at billions.

1. Subjects with free will probably don't exist, and if they do, they're a result of the universe. The belief that the universe or the big bang has to be preceeded by anything akin to human conciousness is incredibly human - and wrong. Conciousness is (probably an illusion and) born out of neurological and psychological (biological) conditions. Those can't exist without the universe. Therefore no conciousness, no god without a universe. Also, even if you ignore that, it's a gigantic logical leap to go from ""we can't explain something"" to  ""therefore god"".
2. Yes, evolution is unlikely, but the universe is big. So big, that the chances of life having developed somewhere else are incredibly high.
3.There is no drive for greatness in modern evolutionary theory (there were however some christian theorists that preceeded Darwin that believed in that sorta thing). Modern evolutionary theory instead believe that there are occasionally genetic mutations and a lot of mixing between genetic codes among species. Those codes then make up the properties of the individual membera of that species. Those whose code works well in the environment survive long enough to spread their code get to spread their genes through sex, thos whose codes suck, don't after a while the code changes because of this. That's what we call evolution. The drive for procreation exists, because the genetic code that caused that drive proved to be more advantageous.
4. The whole no creation without a creator is again very human and very limited by the subjectively human perspective. If you accept that existence doesn't merely functions according to human parameters your whole argument falls apart. All of the points above should be a sufficiant example of this... According to them you are no creation, but a reaction to a reaction to a reaction and so on. What would be more accurate is ""no creation without causes""... That cause doesn't have to be god though.
5. Moral codes could easily be subjectively passed on from generation to generation. Also they're definetly not identical interculturally.",no
YouTube," @johnalden9364  There ARE no contemporaneous historical accounts of Jesus. None. Josephus is talking about the existence of CHRISTIANS, not CHRIST. You don't need a diety to have worshippers of that diety. Just look around at all the religions today -- are you going to tell me that all the Indian gods exist? Are you going to tell me Scientology is true?

The earliest stories about Jesus were written at least 70 years AFTER he was supposed to have DIED. Look at what happens TODAY in the media and on-line. We have video cameras and other recording devices and people STILL misquote and get stories wrong, with stuff that happens TODAY. Imagine trying to report on something that happened 3 generations ago, with only word-of-mouth.

For example, rocks are hard and durable, but even the seas (made up of of water) can erode the roughest cliffs in time. Daoists particularly emphasized the qualities of Yin energy.",no

YouTube,"The Chinese concept of “heaven” is the same word as “sky”. It’s a reference to the idea of basic decency and self-evident morals. When the Chinese historian say “xxxx losing the Mandate of Heaven” it’s similar to “it is plainly to see that xxx is no longer fit to rule and be role models”.

Oh course, people added the flairs of dragons and mysticism to the idea of Mandate of Heaven. But most people understood the emperor are simply people who had power to overthrow the previous emperor and made known their (very politicised and distorted) reasons.


The heavens is also not necessarily religious or mystical. Chinese often have a saying that loosely translate to ‘under heaven’ which just basically means ‘in the world’. Ie ‘this blade is peerless for all under heaven’ is basically ‘this blade is unique in the world’.",no

YouTube,"As an Australian, I humbly thank fellow Migrant Australians for sharing their coffee culture with us.",no
YouTube,"I think a minor point that's missed is that Australian's are very well traveled with most of us having travelled internationally at least once in our lives, so we'd already been exposed to Starbucks at cafe's in other countries - and discovered it was terrible. Huge milkshakes and slushies disguised as coffees, or watery bland filter coffee.
So Australians already had no interest in Starbucks when it eventually arrived in Australia.",no
YouTube,I love how Australians are proud of Starbucks failing there.,no

YouTube,"I remember when Starbucks came to Australia and I new it would fail. We already had a established coffee market and the product that Starbucks was offering was rubbish. The quality of the coffee wasn't good and those weird coffee sugar drinks just didn't go down well. It will be interesting to see what happens in Italy. I don't think the locals will have much to do with it, but being that there are a lot of American tourist in Italy, they'll probably go their to get their coffee then to McDonald's to get their food, so they can feel right at home.",no

YouTube,"When I first opened this video I was very surprised that Starbucks never took off in Australia, being from New Zealand, where Starbucks is a reasonably successful and popular business! The Australian and New Zealand markets are very similar, mostly because culturally we are very similar. However, the point on Italian and Greek immigrants is a pretty solid point and would explain the cafe culture in Australia, which is much more refined than New Zealand's (I hear all the time from my New Zealander friends who have moved to Australia how much better the coffee is over there!). We never had Italian and Greek immigration in New Zealand. Very interesting!",no

YouTube,"I think it also speaks to our local culture. The concept of starbucks isn't designed in a way that you talk or have a conversation, you just see people on their laptops (usually international students, not even businessmen). When the concept of our cafe culture, is that you talk to people, catch up with your barista, infact, you don't even need to tell them your order, as they already know it.
